# Twitter clone frontend

## Project description

This repository contains the code for a Twitter clone I wrote using Angular. I've already created a project like this about a year ago during a full-stack django course, but I've decided to recreate it using a more modern development stack. The back-end part of this project is located in this repository: [twitter-clone-backend](https://github.com/SewerynKras/twitter-clone-backend). Additionally the entire project has been developed using TDD.

Theming for this project was done using Angular Material and Angular Flex Layout.

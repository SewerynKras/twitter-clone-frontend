# Twitter clone frontend

## Project description

This repository contains the code for a Twitter clone I wrote using Angular. I've already created a project like this about a year ago during a full-stack django course, but I've decided to recreate it using a more modern development stack. The back-end part of this project is located in this repository: [twitter-clone-backend](https://github.com/SewerynKras/twitter-clone-backend). Additionally the entire project has been developed using TDD.

## Project highlights

- Test Driven Development
- Highly specialized and reusable components
- Custom theme
- Detailed documentation
- Scalable structure
- Over 90% coverage

## Functionality

- Create and edit your profile
- Create tweets (but in classic Twitter fashion - without the ability to edit them)
- Attach images to tweets and profile pictures to profiles
- Like tweets
- Follow other profiles
- Retweet or comment on tweets
